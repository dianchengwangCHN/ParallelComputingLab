## Lab4

**MPI** practice.

| Directory | Description    |
| --------- | ------------------------- |
| PA4-p1    | Test MPI message transmission speed with different message size and transmission approaches. |
| PA4-p2    | Test message size effect on the deadlock issue in ring communication among processes with the blocking approach. Change to the non-blocking approach to fix the deadlock issue. |
| PA4-p3    | Parallelize a matrix operation program with **MPI**, improving perfromance from 2.63 GFLOPS to 19.59 GFLOPS. |
